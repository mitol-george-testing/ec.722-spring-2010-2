description: An early design (left) and prototype (right) of a pediatric extendable
  prosthesis developed by a student team in the class. In the drawing, rings grasp
  notches in the prosthesis to restrict movement. The team chose to prototype a saw-tooth
  design by cutting an oil-filled nylon rod into two pieces with a water jet. Images
